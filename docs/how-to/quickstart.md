# Quickstart

## Installation

Run the following comand to create a project:

```sh
npm init larana-js my-project
```

You will be prompted a few questions and then your project will be ready.

### Initialization options

> In development.

## Running a project

To run a project run:

```sh
node src/index.js
```

or (if you need hot reload):

```sh
nodemon src/index.js
```

If everything is ok, you will see the host you are running on. By default it's [http://localhost:1610](http://localhost:1610).

Congradulations! You are ready to use LaranaJS!

## Next step

The next step is to understand the [file structure of the project](./file-structure.md).
